# Bell state

This is an example of a simple quantum circuit that creates a Bell state, which is an entangled state of two qubits, using Qiskit.

This code creates a quantum circuit with two qubits, applies a Hadamard gate to the first qubit, and then applies a CNOT gate with the first qubit as the control and the second qubit as the target. It measures the final state of both qubits and simulates the circuit using the Qiskit Aer simulator. The results are displayed as a histogram.
